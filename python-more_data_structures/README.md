# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This directory contains exercises on advanced Python data structures, focusing on sets, dictionaries, and advanced list operations.

## Description

This project covers more advanced Python data structures and their operations, including:
- Sets and set operations
- Dictionaries and dictionary methods
- Lambda functions
- Map, reduce, and filter functions
- List comprehensions
- Advanced list operations

## Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of sets and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files must end with a new line
- First line of all Python files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable

## Files

- `0-square_matrix_simple.py` - Function that computes the square value of all integers in a matrix
- `1-search_replace.py` - Function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list
- `2-uniq_add.py` - Function that adds all unique integers in a list
- `3-common_elements.py` - Function that returns a set of common elements in two sets
- `4-only_diff_elements.py` - Function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set
