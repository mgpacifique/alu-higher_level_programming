# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This directory contains exercises on advanced Python data structures, focusing on sets, dictionaries, and advanced list operations.

## Description

This project covers more advanced Python data structures and their operations, including:
- Sets and set operations
- Dictionaries and dictionary methods
- Lambda functions
- Map, reduce, and filter functions
- List comprehensions
- Advanced list operations

## Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of sets and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions
