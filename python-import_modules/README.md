# Python - Import & Modules

This directory contains projects and exercises for learning Python imports and modules.

## Description

This project covers the fundamentals of importing functions, modules, and variables in Python, including:
- Importing functions from other files
- Using command-line arguments with `sys.argv`
- Working with the `dir()` function
- Preventing code execution when imported using `if __name__ == "__main__"`
- Creating and using custom modules

## Learning Objectives

- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files must end with a new line
- First line of all Python files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Files

- `0-add.py` - Program that imports the function `add` and prints the result of addition
- `1-calculation.py` - Program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs math operations
- `2-args.py` - Program that prints the number and list of arguments
- `3-infinite_add.py` - Program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
- `4-hidden_discovery.py` - Program that prints all names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`
- `5-variable_load.py` - Program that imports a variable from another file and prints its value
